This lecture discusses column space and nullspace. The column space of a matrix _A_ tells us when the equation _Ax_ = _b_ will have a solution _x_. The nullspace of _A_ tells us which values of _x_ solve the equation _Ax_ = 0.

These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded in Fall 1999 and do not correspond precisely to the current edition of the textbook. However, this book is still the best reference for more information on the topics covered in each lecture.
