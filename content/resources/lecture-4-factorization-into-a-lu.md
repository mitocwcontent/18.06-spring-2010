This session explains inverses, transposes and permutation matrices. We also learn how elimination leads to a useful factorization _A_ = _LU_ and how hard a computer will work to invert a very large matrix.

These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded in Fall 1999 and do not correspond precisely to the current edition of the textbook. However, this book is still the best reference for more information on the topics covered in each lecture.
